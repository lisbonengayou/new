    <h1>Dubai!!!</h1>
    <p>Dubai is situated on the 
        <b>Persian Gulf</b> 
         coast of the United Arab Emirates
        and is roughly at sea level (16 m or 52 ft above). 
        The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, 
        <b>Sharjah</b>
         in the northeast, and the 
         <b>Sultanate of Oman</b>  
            in the southeast.
 </p>
    <p>
        Dubai lies directly within the <b>Arabian Desert</b> . 
        However, the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of 
        the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai's landscape is 
        highlighted by sandy desert patterns, while gravel deserts dominate 
        much of the southern region of the country.The sand consists mostly 
        of crushed shell and coral and is fine, clean and white. 
        East of the city, the salt-crusted coastal plains, known as <b>sabkha</b> ,
        give way to a northâ€“south running line of dunes. 
        Farther east, the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with <b>iron oxide</b> .
